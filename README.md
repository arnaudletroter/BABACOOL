# BABACOOL

We present the BABACOOL (BAby Brain Atlas COnstruction for Optimized Labeled segmentation) approach for creating multi-modal developmental atlases, which we used to produce BaBa21, a population-based longitudinal developmental baboon template. BaBa21 consists of structural (T1- and T2-weighted) images and tissue probability maps from a population of 21 baboons (Papio anubis) scanned at 4 timepoints beginning from 2 weeks after birth and continuing to sexual maturity (5 years). 

This resource is made available to provide a normalization target for baboon data across the lifespan, and further, facilitate neuroimaging research in baboons, comparative research with humans and nonhuman primate species for which developmental templates are available (e.g., macaques).
